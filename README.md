# AI Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms categorized into different folders such as classification and regression. Each folder contains well-documented code, example datasets, and usage instructions for the included algorithms.

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of foundational machine learning algorithms categorized into classification and regression sections...

## Repository Structure

- **classification/**  
  Contains algorithms for supervised classification tasks, such as Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), Naive Bayes, and others.

- **regression/**  
  Contains algorithms focused on regression tasks, including Linear Regression, Locally Weighted Regression, and related models.

Additional folders and algorithms will be added over time to expand the repository.

## Getting Started

Each folder has its own README with details on the algorithms implemented, setup instructions, and example usage. Please refer to those for more information.
