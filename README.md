# AI Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms categorized into different folders such as classification and regression. Each folder contains well-documented code, example datasets, and usage instructions for the included algorithms.

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of foundational machine learning algorithms categorized into classification and regression sections...

## Personal Motivation
I developed this project to deepen my understanding of foundational machine learning algorithms, specifically classification models like Gaussian Discriminant Analysis and Softmax Regression. Implementing these algorithms from scratch helped me grasp the mathematical concepts and practical challenges behind supervised learning methods.

My goal is to apply these skills to real-world data problems, especially in personality prediction and behavioral analytics, which aligns with my research interests. Preparing this project also supports my application for Mitacs, where I hope to collaborate on data-driven research and contribute meaningful insights through machine learning.

## Repository Structure

- **classification/**  
  Contains algorithms for supervised classification tasks, such as Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), Naive Bayes, and others.

- **regression/**  
  Contains algorithms focused on regression tasks, including Linear Regression, Locally Weighted Regression, and related models.

Additional folders and algorithms will be added over time to expand the repository.

## Getting Started

Each folder has its own README with details on the algorithms implemented, setup instructions, and example usage. Please refer to those for more information.
